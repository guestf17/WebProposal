			<h2>Background Research</h2>
    	  <h3 id="mission">Mission</h3>
          <p>“WIRES have been serving wildlife and the community for over 30 years and we are Australia’s largest wildlife rescue organisation. WIRES is dedicated to the protection and preservation of native animals. We provide wildlife information and education to the community nationally and we’re licenced to rescue and care for wildlife in NSW.” </p>
		
			  <h3 id="information">Key Information and Statistics</h3>
          <h4> Introduction </h4>
			      <p>The objective of understanding the goals and mission of WIRES, was to help shape the user research. Research into what WIRES does, provided context in regard to the type of people that would use this type of foundation. The key insights were also an essential step into defining and understanding the problem presented.</p>
          <h4> Key Insights </h4>
      			<ul>
				      <li>Previous 12months: one of the worst droughts in history, bushfires and dubbed Australia’s Black Summer</li>
				      <li>20% of Australian forests were lost</li>
				      <li>Hundreds of species at risk of extinction</li>
              <li>3 Billion animals killed or displaced</li>
              <li>From Jan to August WIRES volunteers accepted over 21,600 wildlife rescues</li>
		      	</ul>
        <h3 id="problem">Problem</h3>
          <h4> Definiton </h4>
           <p>Resulting from Australia’s ‘Black Summer’, there has been a vast increase of animals needing qualified care and treatment. WIRES is an organisation that trains volunteers to look after these animals. However, since the bushfires levels of volunteers and animals needing care have both increased, thus costs of training volunteers and providing equipment have risen too. Although donations have increased in the post bushfire world, a lot of the funding for WIRES is received through the government. In order to help train these volunteers and care for these displaced animals, more donations are required.</p>
          <h4> Statement </h4>
           <p>“How can a website receiving large traffic be designed to encourage these users to become donators or potential volunteers”</p>
      
        <h3 id="users">User Research</h3>
          <h4> Introduction </h4>
            <p>The objective for the user research is to determine which demographic donates the least amount of money, and outline methods that prompt these users to donate.  Secondary research will be conducted to learn the demographic, and primary research will be conducted to learn the methods. Despite the primary objective being this, an understanding of other demographics willing to donate, will be recorded, as the final design should not hinder these user’s ability to or want to donate to WIRES.</p>
         <h4> Secondary Research </h4>
            <p>Males aged 25-34 were least likely to donate to causes related to animals (M. Cooper, 2019). However as indicated by Abby Jarvis, men aged 18-34, were the most likely demographic to give charitably. This indicates there is an uneven distribution in these donations. Furthermore, males in Australia during the 2017-18 period donated $2.15 billion, for an average donation of $982.39. This was slightly higher than the $1.6 Billion donated by Australian females during the same period (Emeritus Professor Myles McGregor-Lowndes, Marie Balczun and Dr Alexandra Williamson, 2020). During this research it was uncovered that white women aged 18-24 were most likely to donate to animal related charities (M. Cooper 2019). Furthermore, these motivations were linked to higher level of empathy towards animals present in this demographic (M. Smith, 2018). The final demographic researched was that of the which demographic volunteers the most. Again this was white females, however they were aged 40 – 59, married and with pets (Sandra L. Neumanm, 2015).</p>
          <h4> Primary Research </h4>
            <p>Online ethnography was utilised to understand methods that encourage males aged 25-34 to donate money. The insights were as follows;</p>
      	      <ul>
				        <li>Tax Relief / deductions</li>
				        <li>Competition</li>
				        <li>Aesthetics</li>
                <li>Quick / easy to use / access</li>
                <li>Family and friends donate too</li>
			          </ul>
			  <h3 id="profiles">User Profiles</h3>
			    <p>This section was utilised to help further understand the three demographics discussed above. They help visualise the important insights that will help form design decisions when creating the website.</p>

			  <h2>Ideation</h2>

			    <h3 id="site map">Site Map</h3>
            <figure>
              <img src="Site_Map.png" class="rotate90"/>
            </figure>
            <p>The proposed website has 4 pages. A simple yet effective plan, with a clear goal of funnelling users to the donations page. There are two separate forms as well, one used for registration, to collect a user’s contact information, while the other is for donations, collecting credit card information.</p>
            <p>Two types of arrows are present on the form, representing the links between the pages, a solid arrow is a direct link to the other page, whereas a dotted line represents the ability to navigate to said page.</p>
            <p>The red pen represents personal reflection, and some goals that would help respond to the proposed problem. It also outlines initial ideas for content that could be placed onto each page.</p>

          
          <h3 id="sketches">Sketches</h3>
            <h4> Intial </h4>
                <figure>
              <img src="Sketches_Home.png" class="rotate90"/>
            </figure>
             <ol>
               	<li>The goal of this sketch was to respond to the problem, create a clear call to action, with ease of navigation. This was archived as the call to actions have been labelled in red, and the navigation menu is simple yet effective.</li>
				        <li>The second iteration of the homepage was to make the interface look cleaner, whilst still having simple navigation and clear call to action. The changes were minimal; however, they make significant differences to the aesthetics of the page.</li>
				        <li>The third iteration utilised a carousel design, a popular method of displaying multiple images. This really boosted the look of page, making it look a lot more modern. Another alteration was to move the menu to the right-hand corner, separating the logo on the left, this increases the balance on the web page, a very important design principle.</li>
                <li>Continuing with the carousel design, the fourth iteration of the home page moved the images to background, making them the full width and height of the web page. This is a recent design trend, which allows the for the message, or call to action in the case of this webpage to sit atop the image, displaying a clear level of hierarchy, another important design principle.</li>
                <li>The final iteration of the homepage had minimal changes to the fourth, however, the menu was changed from buttons to just text and the logo was shrunken slightly. Both these changes were created to have a clear focus on the call to action. The final change was to remove the carousel design, and make it scrollable, this makes the website more interactive, and simpler to navigate for those in a rush.</li>
             </ol>
          <img src="Sketches_About.png" class="rotate90"/>
            </figure>
            <ol>
              <li>The first iteration of the about us page focuses on the information, with different background colours separating unrelated information. Furthermore, it was decided that the menu bar would pin to the top of the page, and a transparent header would appear to encase it as user would scroll through the web page. This change was added, in case users were finding it difficult to read the text on images.</li>
              <li>The second iteration added images to the information, as readers can often feel overwhelmed by bodies of text. These images would help keep user engaged, and not feel overwhelmed.</li>
              <li>The final iteration, combined the first two, creating an aesthetic page, which allows users to learn about the foundation, but also engage with the topics being described.</li>
            </ol>
          <img src="Sketches_Donations.png" class="rotate270"/>
            </figure> 
            <ol>
              <li>The iteration took the same design as the home page, as the design had good balance, clear hierarchy and worked well for this particular page as well.</li>
              <li>The second iteration kept the same design principles as the first, but focused on usability, allowing the user to type an amount they wish to donate before filling out the form.</li>
              <li>The final iteration really focused on usability, responding to how the target user prefers to donate quickly and easily. Buttons have been incorporated with quick and easy donation amounts, with the option of another amount.</li>
            </ol>
          <img src="Sketches_Volunteer.png" class="rotate90"/>
            </figure> 
            <ol>
              <li>The first iteration is essentially a carbon copy of the about us page, focusing on the information necessary for users to volunteer.</li>
              <li>The second had a similar aspect but threw in some statistics and images to help drive in the message and engage users more.</li>
              <li>Both the first two iterations, were not looking very pretty, which is one of the main motivations for the target user to donate, and as such, the third iteration focused purely on the aesthetics and call to action, utilising the same principles described in the home page sketches to achieved this goal.</li>
            </ol>

            <h4> Final </h4>
              <figure>
                <img src="Final_Home.png"/>
              </figure>
                <p>This final design for the home page is taken directly from the fifth iteration. It focuses on the call to action of donating. The background image changes as user scrolls through webpage. The menu bar will pin to the top, with slightly transparent box for easy navigation. Finally statistics will appear with information about WIRES to encourage users to support</p>
              <figure>
                <img src="Final_About.png"/>
              </figure>
                <p> The final design for this layout is inspired by both iteration one and three, taking important aspects from both. No background image is present when navigating too page, as powerful message is to be displayed, and the image could take away or distract the user from said message. As user scrolls through webpage however, images will appear, as this helps keep users engaged.</p>
              <figure>
                <img src="Final_Donations.png"/>
              </figure>
                <p> The donate page is inspired by iteration three, focusing on accessibility and aesthetics. As users scrolls through webpage, they will learn about donating, and this will increase their likelihood to donate. </p>
              <figure>
                <img src="Final_Volunteer.png"/>
              </figure>
                <p> Design of volunteer page is taken from iteration 3. As users scroll through web page, three heading will appear with information opposite the headings. This will help users wishing to volunteer, understand what they will be doing, and what they are required to have knowledge of prior to volunteering. Once user reaches bottom, the call to action will be reinforced. </p>
              <figure>
                <img src="Mobile_Home.png"/>
              </figure>
                <p> This utilises the exact same design as the desktop, as it responds to the problem and is easily scaled down. The menu has been changed to the popular burger menu, as this method works very well on mobile UIs, and the existing menu would not translate. </p>
              <figure>
                <img src="Mobile_About.png"/>
              </figure>
                <p> Images have been placed behind text, as mobile screens are not wide enough to allow for the desktop design to transfer well. Placing the text on top of the image permits the font to be larger, increasing the readability. This allows the page to still have an aesthetic feel, but function as it was supposed to.</p>
              <figure>
                <img src="Mobile_Donations.png"/>
              </figure>
                <p> The multiple buttons for amounts, would not work on a phone screen as intended, so they have been replaced by one button, still allowing high usability and ease of access. Images have been resized, to appear above text, as initial design would not translate to mobile.</p>
              <figure>
                <img src="Mobile_Volunteer.png"/>
              </figure>
                <p>Moved heading from next to the body of text, to above, allows for a larger font to be utilised and easier readability on the mobile interface.</p>

          <h3 id="moodboards">Mood Boards</h3>
            <p> The mood board was utilised as a method to try and understand what colours work weel with one another. The focus of this particular mood board was various citrus and fruit. These particular images lead to colours chosen for the website, as indicated by the blocks in the centre.</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="Mood-Board.png"/>
            </figure>

			    <h3 id="style guide">Style Guide</h3>
            <h4> Colours </h4>
              <ul>
				        <li>Red – chosen as it is a colour of extremes, it is also often a symbol of power (J. L. Morton, 1995).</li>
				        <li>Orange – chosen as it evokes strong emotion and radiates warmth and energy (D. Kerpen, 2013).</li>
				        <li>Yellow – chosen for as it communicates sunlight, enlightenment and often linked with increased mental awareness (D. Przbyla, 2017).</li>
                <li>Light Green – chosen for its soft and versatile look (K. Tucker, 2018), matches with white, to create a bright and clean overall aesthetic.</li>
                <li>Dark Green – chosen as it symbolises nature and the natural world (K. Cherry, 2020).</li>
			        </ul>
            <h4> Font </h4>
              <p> Helvetica Neue, was chosen for three main reasons, legibility, readability and familiarity. Helvetica Neue has high legibility as each character is easily distinguishable from one another, improving the websites accessability. It also has has readability, as it was designed specifically to ensure its simplicity (K. Sanders 2016). Lastly, Helvetica has high familiarity, as many famous brands such as Apple, Microsoft and Jeep use a variation in their logo. These were the driving forces that led to this particular choice of font. </p>

			  <h3 id="wireframes">Wireframes</h3>
          <p> The wireframes did not alter any of the designs presented in the sketches, they simply provided an understanding of how the website will appear without colour, content and images. They also prove useful in developing the final mockups </p>
