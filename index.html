			<h2>Background Research</h2>
    	  <h3 id="mission">Mission</h3>
          <p>“WIRES have been serving wildlife and the community for over 30 years and we are Australia’s largest wildlife rescue organisation. WIRES is dedicated to the protection and preservation of native animals. We provide wildlife information and education to the community nationally and we’re licenced to rescue and care for wildlife in NSW.” </p>
		
			  <h3 id="information">Key Information and Statistics</h3>
          <h4> Introduction </h4>
			      <p>The objective of understanding the goals and mission of WIRES, was to help shape the user research. Research into what WIRES does, provided context in regard to the type of people that would use this type of foundation. The key insights were also an essential step into defining and understanding the problem presented.</p>
          <h4> Key Insights </h4>
      			<ul>
				      <li>Previous 12months: one of the worst droughts in history, bushfires and dubbed Australia’s Black Summer</li>
				      <li>20% of Australian forests were lost</li>
				      <li>Hundreds of species at risk of extinction</li>
              <li>3 Billion animals killed or displaced</li>
              <li>From Jan to August WIRES volunteers accepted over 21,600 wildlife rescues</li>
		      	</ul>
        <h3 id="Problem">Problem</h3>
          <h4> Definiton </h4>
           <p>Resulting from Australia’s ‘Black Summer’, there has been a vast increase of animals needing qualified care and treatment. WIRES is an organisation that trains volunteers to look after these animals. However, since the bushfires levels of volunteers and animals needing care have both increased, thus costs of training volunteers and providing equipment have risen too. Although donations have increased in the post bushfire world, a lot of the funding for WIRES is received through the government. In order to help train these volunteers and care for these displaced animals, more donations are required.</p>
          <h4> Statement </h4>
           <p>“How can a website receiving large traffic be designed to encourage these users to become donators or potential volunteers”</p>
      
        <h3 id="users">User Research</h3>
          <h4> Introduction </h4>
            <p>The objective for the user research is to determine which demographic donates the least amount of money, and outline methods that prompt these users to donate.  Secondary research will be conducted to learn the demographic, and primary research will be conducted to learn the methods. Despite the primary objective being this, an understanding of other demographics willing to donate, will be recorded, as the final design should not hinder these user’s ability to or want to donate to WIRES.</p>
         <h4> Secondary Research </h4>
            <p>Males aged 25-34 were least likely to donate to causes related to animals (M. Cooper, 2019). However as indicated by Abby Jarvis, men aged 18-34, were the most likely demographic to give charitably. This indicates there is an uneven distribution in these donations. Furthermore, males in Australia during the 2017-18 period donated $2.15 billion, for an average donation of $982.39. This was slightly higher than the $1.6 Billion donated by Australian females during the same period (Emeritus Professor Myles McGregor-Lowndes, Marie Balczun and Dr Alexandra Williamson, 2020). During this research it was uncovered that white women aged 18-24 were most likely to donate to animal related charities (M. Cooper 2019). Furthermore, these motivations were linked to higher level of empathy towards animals present in this demographic (M. Smith, 2018). The final demographic researched was that of the which demographic volunteers the most. Again this was white females, however they were aged 40 – 59, married and with pets (Sandra L. Neumanm, 2015).</p>
          <h4> Primary Research </h4>
            <p>Online ethnography was utilised to understand methods that encourage males aged 25-34 to donate money. The insights were as follows;</p>
      	      <ul>
				        <li>Tax Relief / deductions</li>
				        <li>Competition</li>
				        <li>Aesthetics</li>
                <li>Quick / easy to use / access</li>
                <li>Family and friends donate too</li>
			          </ul>
			  <h3 id="profiles">User Profiles</h3>
			    <p>This section was utilised to help further understand the three demographics discussed above. They help visualise the important insights that will help form design decisions when creating the website.</p>
